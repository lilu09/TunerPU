TunerPU is a library that allows to abstract a set of components
that have the same interface to a structure so that TunerPU
can perform implementation selection automatically.

See examples for more information.

To setup, one need to download MeterPU and VectorPU as well,

MeterPU: git clone https://github.com/lilu09/meterpu.git
VectorPU: git clone https://github.com/lilu09/vectorpu.git

Or more conveniently, clone the repo that contains TunerPU,
MeterPU, and VectorPU.

git clone https://github.com/lilu09/framework_integration.git
git update --init

To run an example successfully,

cd examples/3.3d_matrix_matrix_mul_tested
make
make run
xdot tree_depth_2.dot
